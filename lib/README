Most of the header files in this directory are for internal use by the
library.  The only two you're likely to #include within your program are
mysql++.hh and custom.hh.  The latter you only need if you are using the
SQLSS custom macros.

For those interesting in improving the code the files are laid out in
the following fashion:

name0.hh: Header files ending in a 0.hh generally cantains macro
  defintions and other messy stuff.

name1.hh: Header files ending in 1.hh contain just the class as
  functions declarations and really simple inline functions.  A 1.hh
  header file should never include anything but other 1.hh header
  files.

name2.hh: Header files ending in 2.hh contain inline functions and 
  methods.  They should generally only include other 1.hh or 2.hh
  header files however they may also include 3.hh and 4.hh header
  files if, for example, they want to instantiate the necessary
  template functions.
  
name3.hh: Header files ending in 3.hh contain non-inline template 
  functions and methods.

name4.hh: Header files ending in 4.hh contain template functions
  which the library itself instantiates.  Thus these should only be
  included from other 4.hh or .cc files in this directory.

name.cc: These contain the library's non-template function and method 
  definitions, and templates instantiated only within that .cc file.
