Hi!
remember me? the guy obssessed with makin mysql++ for mac?
well  found something that's quite good, it's a site that made a plugin for the
realbasic that allows to use mysql, and it has the free C source of their mysql
client lib!
that means I can work now!
If you can make some time, check this two sites out...
This one says what version of mysql lib is ported and some nice stuff...
http://www.essencesw.com/Software/mysqllib.html
and this is a library that emulates BSD sockets, also that you can use pthreads on
MacOS, check it out
