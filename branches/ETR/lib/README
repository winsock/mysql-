All of the header files in this dir (sqlplusint) are internal.  This
means that you should never include any of these directly in your
programs as they are subject to change from one relese to another.

For those interesting in improving the code the files are laid out in
the following fashion:

name0.hh: Header files ending in a 0.hh generally cantains macro
  defantions and other messy stuff.
name1.hh: Header files ending in 1.hh contain just the class as
  functions declartions and really simple inline functions.  A 1.hh
  header file should never include anything but other 1.hh header
  files.
name2.hh: Header files ending in 2.hh contain inline functions and 
  methods.  They should generally only include other 1.hh or 2.hh
  header files however they may also include 3.hh and 4.hh header
  files if, for example, they want to instantiate the nessary template
  functions.
name3.hh: Header files ending in 3.hh contain non-inline template 
  functions and methods.
name4.hh: Header files ending in 4.hh contain template functions in
  which are the nessary instances should already be instanstaed.  Thus
  these should never be included in the end users program.  Only
  within other 4.hh or .cc files in this directory.
name.cc: These contain the actual functions and methods coresponding
  the the appreate header file.  They may include templates procided
  that the nessary instances will all be instantiated by the end of
  the .cc file
