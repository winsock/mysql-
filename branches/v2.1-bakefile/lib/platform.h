/// \file platform.h
/// \brief This file includes things that help the rest of MySQL++
//	remain unaware of platform differences.
///
/// This file includes all of the platform-specific definitions that
/// allow the rest of the code to be aware only of platform features,
/// rather than aware of specific platforms.  On Unixy systems, it
/// #includes the autoconf-generated header config.h, and on all other
/// platforms it includes the tests for platform features directly.
