Building the Examples on Unixy Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	If you are seeing these examples in a subdirectory of the MySQL++
	source tarball, the example programs should have been built when
	you built the library.	If you change any example code, just say
	'make' and make(1) will use the Makefile generated by automake
	from Makefile.am.  The programs are built against the headers
	and library in ../lib/.

	If these example files were installed on your system as part of
	the -devel RPM, copy all the files to a directory you can write
	to, then say 'make' in that directory.	This uses a different,
	simpler Makefile, which builds the examples against the headers
	and libraries installed in the system directories.


Building the Examples on Other Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	If your particular build environment is supported, there should
	be specific instructions in the README.* file named after it in
	the directory above this one.


General Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Start with resetdb:

		$ ./resetdb [host] [user] [password] [port]

	This sets up the mysql_cpp_data database used by most of the
	other examples.

	You can give as few of the parameters as you want, but they must
	be in that order.  That is, if you want to give a user name,
	you must give the host first.  It defaults to localhost with
	your user name, no password, and the default MySQL port (3306).


	The following examples use the database set up by resetdb,
	and have the same command line format as resetdb:

		simple1: Gets all records in the table resetdb set up and
			displays them.  Try this one if you do nothing else.

		fieldinf1: Shows how to get information about the fields in
			a result set.  (Types, etc.)

		custom1-5: Demonstrates the SQLSS features.  (See the docs.)

		dbinfo: Dumps a bunch of information about the database
			server and the tables in its 'mysql' database.


	The following are kind of oddballs.  You will have to change
	the source code to get them to run, since they use hard-coded
	table and database names which aren't the same as those set up
	by resetdb.

		load_file, cgi_image: Shows how to use a BLOB field to store
			a file, and how to retrieve the file from the DB.

		updel: Shows how to use the power of the matching syntax
			available in MySQL's SELECT statement to do fine-grained
			UPDATE or DELETE queries.
