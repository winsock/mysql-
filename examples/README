Building the Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	If you are seeing these examples in a subdirectory of the MySQL++
	source tarball, the example programs should have been built when
	you built the library.	If you change any example code, just say
	'make' to rebuild the program.
	
	The examples are built against the headers and library in ../lib.

	If these example files were installed on your system as part
	of the -devel RPM, copy all the files to a directory you can
	write to, then say 'make' in that directory.  This uses a
	simplified Makefile, which builds the examples against the
	headers and libraries installed in the system directories.


General Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Start with resetdb:

		$ ./resetdb [host] [user] [password] [port]

	This sets up the mysql_cpp_data database used by most of the
	other examples.

	You can give as few of the parameters as you want, but they must
	be in that order.  That is, if you want to give a user name,
	you must give the host first.  It defaults to localhost with
	your user name, no password, and the default MySQL port (3306).


	The following examples use the database set up by resetdb,
	and have the same command line format as resetdb:

		simple1: Gets all records in the table resetdb set up and
			displays them.  Try this one if you do nothing else.

		simple2: Same as simple1, except that it retrieves
			the data with a "use" query instead of a
			"store" query.	See the user manual for the
			difference between these.

		fieldinf1: Shows how to get information about the fields in
			a result set.  (Types, etc.)

		custom1-6: Demonstrates the SQLSS features.  (See the user
			manual.)

		dbinfo: Dumps a bunch of information about the database
			server and the tables in its 'mysql' database.


	The following are kind of oddballs.  You will have to change
	the source code to get them to run, since they use hard-coded
	table and database names which aren't the same as those set up
	by resetdb.

		load_file, cgi_image: Shows how to use a BLOB field to store
			a file, and how to retrieve the file from the DB.

		updel: Shows how to use the power of the matching syntax
			available in MySQL's SELECT statement to do fine-grained
			UPDATE or DELETE queries.
