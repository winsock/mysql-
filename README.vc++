The included project files (mysql++.sln and all the *.vcproj files) work
with Visual C++ 7.1, part of Visual Studio 2003.

The only thing you're likely to need to change is the location of the
MySQL client library.  I installed MySQL in c:\Program Files\mysql on
my development system, so it'll work without change if you do the same.
