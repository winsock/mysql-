MySQL++ was created by Kevin Atkinson <kevinatk@home.com> during 1998.

From version 1.0 (released in June 1999) through 1.7.9 (May 2001), the
primary maintainer was Sinisa Milivojevic <sinisa@mysql.com>, currently an
employee of MySQL AB. Although the library went into stasis with 1.7.9,
Sinisa continued to run the mailing list and support users through that
mailing list.

In August of 2004, Warren Young <mysqlpp@etr-usa.com> took over as
library maintainer. The first release under his leadership was 1.7.10.

For a fuller account of the library's history, see the first page of the
reference manual, or the Doxygen comment at the end of lib/mysql++.h,
from which that page is built.


Other frequent contributors since 1.7.10 are:

	Chris Frey <cdfrey@netdirect.ca>: Lots of GCC warning fixes for
	the bleeding-edge compiler versions, and Gentoo ebuild support.
	Also, if there were a "steering committee" for MySQL++, he'd be
	on it.

	Totte Karlsson <tkarlsson@qm.com>: Primary force behind Borland
	C++ Builder support.

	Evan Wies <evan@athenacr.com>: Contributed several C++ code
	style cleanups.


Here are the personal credits from the old 1.7.9 documentation,
apparently written by Kevin Atkinson:

	Chris Halverson - For helping me get it to compile under Solaris.

	Fredric Fredricson - For a long talk about automatic conversions.

	Michael Widenius - MySQL developer who has been very supportive of
		my efforts.

	Paul J. Lucas - For the original idea of treating the query object
		like a stream.

	Scott Barron - For helping me with the shared libraries.

	Jools Enticknap - For giving me the Template Queries idea.

	M. S. Sriram - For a detailed dission of how the Template Queries
		should be implemented, the suggestion to throw exceptions on bad
		queries, and the idea of having a back-end independent query
		object (ie SQLQuery).

	Sinisa Milivojevic - For becoming the new offical maintainer.

	D. Hawkins and E. Loic for their autoconf + automake contribution.


See the ChangeLog for further credits, and details about the differences
between the many versions of this library.


Please do not email any of these people with general questions about
MySQL++. All of us who are still active in MySQL++ development read the
mailing list, so questions sent there do get to us:

	http://lists.mysql.com/plusplus

The mailing list is superior to private email because the answers are
archived for future questioners to find, and because you are likely to
get answers from more people.
