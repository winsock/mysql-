The original creator of the library seems to be Kevin Atkinson
<kevinatk@home.com>. I say "seems", because he hasn't been heard from
in years. His involvement is well before my time.

From version 1.2 through 1.7.9, the primary maintainer was Sinisa
Miliojevic <sinisa@mysql.com>, currently an employee of MySQL AB.

When it became clear that Sinisa was unable to put any more time into the
library, I (Warren Young <mysqlpp@etr-usa.com>) took over the library.
The first release under this new leadership was 1.7.10, and it continues
to this day.

Other frequent contributors since 1.7.10 are:

	Chris Frey <cdfrey@netdirect.ca>: Lots of GCC warning fixes for
	the bleeding-edge compiler versions, and Gentoo ebuild support.
	Also, if there were a "steering committee" for MySQL++, he'd be
	on it.

	Totte Karlsson <tkarlsson@qm.com>: Primary force behind Borland
	C++ Builder support.

	Evan Wies <evan@athenacr.com>: Contributed several C++ code
	style cleanups.

See the ChangeLog for further credits, and details about the differences
between the many versions of this library.

Please do not email any of these people with general questions about
MySQL++. All of us who are still active in MySQL++ development read the
mailing list, so questions sent there do get to us:

	http://lists.mysql.com/plusplus

The mailing list is superior to private email because the answers are
archived for future questioners to find, and because you are likely to
get answers from more people.
