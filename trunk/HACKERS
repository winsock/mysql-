If you are going to make any changes to MySQL++, this file has some
hints and commentary you may find helpful.


Subversion Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	To check out the current development version from the Gna!
	Subversion repository, say:

		$ svn co svn://svn.gna.org/svn/mysqlpp/trunk mysqlpp

	If you're a MySQL++ committer, use svn over ssh instead:
	
		$ svn co svn+ssh://LOGIN@svn.gna.org/svn/mysqlpp/trunk mysqlpp

	where LOGIN is your Gna! login name.  You will have to have your
	ssh public key registered with Gna! for this to work.


Submitting Patches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	If you wish to submit a patch to the library, please send it to
	the MySQL++ mailing list.  We want it in unified diff format.

	The easiest way to do this is to check out a copy of the current
	MySQL++ tree as described in the previous section.  Then make
	your change, cd to the root directory of the project, and ask
	Subversion to generate the diff for you:

		$ svn diff > mychange.patch

	If your patch adds new files to the distribution, you can say
	"svn add newfile" before you do the diff, which will include
	the contents of that file in the patch.  (You can do this even
	when you've checked out the tree anonymously.)	Then say "svn
	revert newfile" to make Subversion forget about the new file.

	If you're making a patch against a MySQL++ distribution tarball,
	then you can generate the diff this way:

		$ diff -ruN mysql++-olddir mysql++-newdir > mychange.patch

	The diff command is part of every Unix and Linux system, and
	should be installed by default.  If you're on a Windows machine,
	GNU diff is part of Cygwin (http://cygwin.com/).  Subversion is
	also available for all of these systems.  There are no excuses
	for not being able to make unified diffs.  :)


Adding Support for a Different Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	One of the most common requests we get is to add support
	for less common compilers or build systems.  We're happy to
	accept patches to add such support, provided they comply with
	certain rules.

	We don't want proprietary "project files" and such.  We find
	that they tend to "rot" quickly.  It's human nature for a
	person to submit such a file, and then fail to maintain it.
	Meanwhile, the library keeps changing, so the project file
	becomes less and less relevant over time.  The project
	maintainers cannot reliably maintain these files, because we
	don't have access to the tools that use them.  To avoid this,
	we've settled on two build systems: GNU autotools for Unixy
	systems, and our own 'makemake' system for everything else.
	Because the project maintainers actively use both of these,
	the maintenance to track most library changes is on our
	shoulders.  It isn't a perfect system, but it's better than
	the alternative.

	We're not willing to accept patches that provide only partial
	library support.  In the past, we've had broken ports that
	were missing important library features, or that crashed when
	built in certain ways.	If you can't provide feature parity
	with the existing ports, we're not interested.	The reason is,
	few will knowingly use a crippled version of MySQL++, since
	the alternatives are usually acceptable.  Therefore, such ports
	become maintenance baggage, with little compensating value.


Maintaining a Private CVS Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	You may find it helpful to maintain your own CVS repository.
	Whenever there is a new MySQL++ release, import it on the vendor
	branch like this:

		$ cvs import -m "Version 1.7.35" software/mysql++ mysql++ mysql++-1_7_35

	(This assumes that you have your CVSROOT environment variable
	set properly.)

	Update the HEAD branch like this:

		$ cd mysql++
		$ cvs update -PdA
		$ cvs update -j HEAD -j mysql++-1_7_35 -Pd
		$ cvs ci -m "merged 1.7.35 into HEAD"
		$ cvs tag mysql++-1_7_35-merged

	Then any changes you make can easily be tracked, and diffs can
	be produced with rdiff:

		$ cvs rdiff -ru mysql++-1_7_35 -r mysql++-1_7_35_equal_list \
			$(cat CVS/Repository) > equal_list.patch


On Manipulating the Autotools Input Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	If you are going to hack on the autotools files (*.am, *.in and
	everything in the config subdir), run the command:

		$ ./bootstrap [pedantic] [options]

	The primary purpose of this command is to rebuild all the
	autotools output files, and to enable "maintainer mode".
	In maintainer mode, the build system is set up such that if you
	change any of these autotools input files in the future, their
	dependents will be re-generated automatically.	Occasionally
	automake/autoconf gets confused and you have to run it again,
	but this is rare.

	If the first argument to the bootstrap script is 'pedantic'
	(without the quotes) it will turn on a bunch of GCC-specific
	flags which make the compiler much pickier about the source
	code it will accept without warnings.  It is useful to enable
	this mode whenever you are making large changes to the library,
	to ensure that you haven't done something silly.  We strive to
	keep MySQL++ in a state where it never gives compiler warnings
	in pedantic mode.  We're not 100% there yet with all compilers,
	but we're trying...

	Anything after the optional pedantic argument is passed as
	arguments to the configure script.  See the README file in
	this directory for more information about the flags that the
	script accepts.
