Patches for any of these thoughtfully considered!

New Feature Requests
--------------------

	o Look through my own code for uses of hand-rolled SQL queries, and
	  try to reduce them to API features.

	o Overload SQLQuery::insert() to accept a pair of STL iterators
	  for mass insertion of a range within a container.

	o Detect thread-safety libraries on systems where this is
	  appropritate.  (e.g., add -pthread when building on Linux.)
	  Without this, using MySQL++ in a threaded program causes crashes.

	o None of the 'custom' examples do an insert.  Make one that does.

	o Get PDF documentation generation working.


Bug Fix/Maintenance Items
-------------------------

	o is_connected() may not be returning the right value.
	  <bayufa@bdg.centrin.net.id>

	o Documentation needs a thorough reworking.

	o Factor tests out of configure.in into individual files in a config
	  subdir.

	o SQLQuery shouldn't derive from std::stringstream.  It should
	  have a private std::stringstream member, and add the function
	  definitions it needs to look like a stringstream.  The Standard
	  C++ library classes were not designed to be subclassed.

	o Visual C++ project files should build a DLL version of the library
	  only, for LGPL reasons.

	o MinGW can't build a DLL for MySQL++.  It has to do with the file
	  reorganization in 1.7.20: if you move everything from row.cc to
	  a new row2.h file and include it in a few strategic locations, it
	  works.  But, this is a bogus fix.  Find the right one.

	o Fold SQLQuery class into Query?  The only reason for the
	  separation goes back to the dream of having MySQL++ be database-
	  independent.
