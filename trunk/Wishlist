Features/Changes Requested
--------------------------

Patches for any of these thoughtfully considered!

	o is_connected() may not be returning the right value.
	  <bayufa@bdg.centrin.net.id>

	o All the redefinitions in define_short.hh are bad code style.
	  We should use the Mysql* ones only, and drop the #defines.

	o Move from strstream to stringstream.  Do any other "obsolete
	  header" fixes that remain.

	o Fix the "cascading include files from hell".

	o Look through my own code for uses of custom SQL queries, and try
	  to reduce them to API features.

	o Does it build under GCC 3.4 yet?
	
	o One report says it still doesn't build under GCC 3.5.

	o Why can Query objects not be reused?

	o Get VC++ to build project without warnings on at least /W3.

	o Documentation could probably use a thorough reworking.

	o VC++ supports 64-bit ints, but not as "long long"s as GCC does.
	  If someone needs 64-bit support, they need to undefine
	  NO_LONG_LONGS in mysql++-windows.hh, use functions like strtoi64()
	  instead of strtoll(), and use __int64 instead of long long.  To do
	  this portably, it isn't a trivial conversion.
