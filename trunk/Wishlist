Features/Changes Requested
--------------------------

Patches for any of these thoughtfully considered!

	o is_connected() may not be returning the right value.
	  <bayufa@bdg.centrin.net.id>

	o define_short.hh is bad code style.  It should be removed, the
	  library should use the short names exclusively, and the whole
	  thing should go into a mysqlpp namespace.

	o Look through my own code for uses of custom SQL queries, and try
	  to reduce them to API features.

	o Does it build under GCC 3.4 yet?
	
	o One report says it doesn't build under what will become GCC 4.0.

	o A report says Query objects cannot be reused.  Verify.

	o Documentation needs a thorough reworking.

	o Overload SQLQuery::insert() to accept a pair of STL iterators
	  for mass insertion of a range within a container.

	o VC++ supports 64-bit ints, but not as "long long"s as GCC does.
	  Is the stuff in defs.h sufficient to fix up this difference?

	o Factor tests out of configure.in into individual files in a config
	  subdir.

	o Fix: "coldata4.hh:11: warning: unused parameter `int dummy'".

	o SQLQuery shouldn't derive from std::stringstream.  It should
	  have a private std::stringstream member, and add the function
	  definitions it needs to look like a stringstream.  The Standard
	  C++ library classes were not designed to be subclassed.
