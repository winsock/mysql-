Patches for any of these thoughtfully considered!

New Feature Requests
--------------------

	o Look through my own code for uses of custom SQL queries, and try
	  to reduce them to API features.

	o Overload SQLQuery::insert() to accept a pair of STL iterators
	  for mass insertion of a range within a container.

	o Detect thread-safety libraries on systems where this is
	  appropritate.  (e.g., add -pthread when building on Linux.)
	  Without this, using MySQL++ in a threaded program causes crashes.


Bug Fix/Maintenance Items
-------------------------

	o is_connected() may not be returning the right value.
	  <bayufa@bdg.centrin.net.id>

	o VC++ supports 64-bit ints, but not as "long long"s as GCC does.
	  Is the stuff in defs.h sufficient to fix up this difference?

	o Documentation needs a thorough reworking.

	o Factor tests out of configure.in into individual files in a config
	  subdir.

	o Fix: "coldata4.hh:11: warning: unused parameter `int dummy'".

	o SQLQuery shouldn't derive from std::stringstream.  It should
	  have a private std::stringstream member, and add the function
	  definitions it needs to look like a stringstream.  The Standard
	  C++ library classes were not designed to be subclassed.

	o Rename *.cc to *.cpp.
