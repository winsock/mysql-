Start with resetdb:

	$ ./resetdb [host] [user] [password]

This sets up the mysql_cpp_data database used by most of the other
examples.

You can give as few of the parameters as you want, but they must be in
that order.  That is, if you want to give a user name, you must give the
host first.  It defaults to localhost with your user name and no password.


The following examples use the database set up by resetdb, and have
the same command line format as resetdb:

	simple1: Basic database access. Try this one if nothing else.

	complic1: Similar to simple1, only more complicated. :)

	fieldinf1: Shows how to get information about the fields in
		a result set.  (Types, etc.)

	custom1-4: Demonstrates the SQLSS features.  (See the docs.)


One of the examples is more of a utility program:

	dbinfo: Dumps a bunch of information about the local database.


The following are kind of oddballs.  You will have to change the source
code to get them to run, since they use hard-coded table and database
names which aren't the same as those set up by resetdb.

	load_file, cgi_image: Shows how to use a BLOB field to store
		a file, and how to retrieve the file from the DB.

	updel_ex: I'm not sure what this one does...
