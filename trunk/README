WHAT IT IS

	MySQL++ is a C++ wrapper for MySQL's C API.

	For authorship credits, see the CREDITS file.

BUILDING THE LIBRARY

	MySQL++ has two supported build systems.

	The first is based on the GNU autotools (autoconf, automake,
	and libtool), and is primarily for Unixy[*] systems.  To build
	the library on such a system, the minimum build commands are:

		$ ./configure
		$ make
		$ su
		# make install

	See README.unix for further details, including useful flags for
	the configure script.

	[*] Unixy = Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, and the "real" Unices.
	Does not include MinGW, MKS, or Microsoft SFU.


	For Win32-based systems other than Cygwin, use makemake.bat.
	If your platform is one of those supported, it will have a
	secondary README file in this directory with more details.


	If your system isn't supported by the autotools or makemake.bat
	systems, you will have to either add that support, or find some
	way to build the library yourself.  We welcome patches to add new
	platform support on the mailing list.  We would much prefer to
	have extensions to the existing build systems than completely
	new systems, such as project files for proprietary IDEs.
	We may accept such files, but the project's history shows that
	they tend to be neglected as new library features are added.
	We're therefore reluctant to accept these.


EXAMPLE PROGRAMS

	You may want to try out the programs in the examples subdirectory
	to ensure that the MySQL++ API and your MySQL database are both
	working properly.  Also, these examples give many examples of the
	proper use of MySQL++.	See examples/README for further details.
