What It Is
~~~~~~~~~~
	MySQL++ is a C++ wrapper for MySQL's C API.

	For authorship information, see the CREDITS file.

	For license information, see the LICENSE file.

	Send feedback and questions to the MySQL++ mailing list:

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	To build MySQL++, you must have the MySQL C API development
	files installed.

	On Unixy systems (Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, "real" Unix...),
	the MySQL development files are installed if you build MySQL
	from source.  If you installed MySQL as a binary package,
	then the development files are often packaged separately from
	the MySQL server itself.  It's common for the package to be
	called "MySQL-devel" or something like that.

	If you're building on Windows with Visual C++, you can install
	the native Win32 port of MySQL from mysql.com.  You should do
	a custom install, as the MySQL++ build system expects MySQL to
	be installed in c:\mysql, and not the directory-du-jour used
	by the changing installer versions.


Unsupported Compliers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	If you're on Windows but want to use some other compiler
	besides Visual C++ or Cygwin GCC, you are currently on
	your own.  We've put forth lots of effort in the past to
	get other compilers working, but for one reason or another,
	all of these ports have been unsatisfactory.

	On Unixy systems, GCC still works best.  Many Unix vendors
	offer their own C++ compilers, but these are currently
	unsupported.  There are also third-party compilers such as
	those from Intel, The Portland Group, and Comeau; again,
	these are unsupported.

	We have nothing in particular against these unsupported
	systems.  We just lack the time and resources to support
	everything ourselves.  If you are sufficiently motivated to
	get MySQL++ working on one of these alternate systems, see
	the HACKERS file first for guidance.  If you follow the advice
	in that file, your patch will be more likely to be accepted.


Building the Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	MySQL++ has two supported build systems.

	The first is based on the GNU autotools, and is primarily
	for Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, and the "real" Unices.
	See README.unix for details.  There's a possiblity that
	it will also work on Cygwin competitors such as MKS, UWin,
	and Microsoft SFU, but this hasn't been tested.

	Mainstream Win32 tool chains are supported -- if at all --
	by the MySQL++-specific 'makemake' system.  If your platform
	is one of those supported, it will have a secondary README
	file in this directory with more details.

	If your system isn't supported by the autotools or makemake
	systems, you will have to either add that support, or find
	some way to build the library yourself.  We welcome patches
	to add new platform support on the mailing list.  We would
	much prefer to have extensions to the existing build systems
	than completely new systems, such as project files for
	proprietary IDEs.  The project's history shows that project
	files tend to be neglected as new library features are added,
	so we're reluctant to accept these.


Example Programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	You may want to try out the programs in the examples subdirectory
	to ensure that the MySQL++ API and your MySQL database are both
	working properly.  Also, these examples give many examples of the
	proper use of MySQL++.	See examples/README for further details.
