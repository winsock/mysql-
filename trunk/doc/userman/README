The user manual is written in XML DocBook format, version 4.2.  We
restrict ourselves to Simplified DocBook 1.1 as much as possible.
(Why these versions?  They're what is installed on the oldest system
I still use, Red Hat Linux 9.)

The most likely cause of build failures is not having the right
processing programs installed.  The Makefile uses two tools that
aren't yet ubiquitous:

	To get from DocBook XML to HTML, we use xsltproc, an XSLT
	processor from the Gnome project (http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/).
	Alternatives that can also work are Saxon and Xalan.  These
	processors all have strengths and weaknesses relative to
	each other.  Since we've built this manual assuming you're
	using xsltproc, the manual plays to its strengths, so another
	processor is likely to look weak by comparison.

	We also use the XSLT processor to convert the DocBook file
	into XSL-FO, a typesetting language designed to be an
	intermediary between XML and a print output format.  We
	then use FOP from the Apache Project (http://xml.apache.org/fop/)
	to convert that to PDF.  There are no free-as-in-freedom
	XSL-FO processors that are better than FOP, in my judgement.
	RenderX's XEP (renderx.com) is avalable in a free-as-in-beer
	version that adds watermarks to your pages.  Another popular
	option is Antenna House's XSL Formatter (antennahouse.com),
	but there is no free offering.  The low-end commercial
	version of each of these is around $300.

The second most likely cause of build failure is that there is some
oddity on your system preventing the XSLT processor from finding
your local stylesheet and DTD files.  There should be a file called
/etc/xml/catalog (or /sw/etc/xml/catalog when using Fink on OS X)
which maps the URLs used in our XML files into references to local
file names on your system.  If that process is broken, and the
document processor cannot pull down the DTDs and/or XSL files from
the Web, the manual will fail to build.  Please post details about
this to the MySQL++ mailing list, so we can try to debug it.  You
might also find the FOP and/or DocBook mailing lists helpful.
