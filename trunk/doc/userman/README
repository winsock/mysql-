The user manual is written in XML DocBook format, version 4.2. We
restrict ourselves to Simplified DocBook 1.1 as much as possible.
(Why these versions? They're the newest supported on the oldest system
I still use, Red Hat Linux 9.)

If the user manual doesn't build, the most likely cause is that the
findxsl script cannot find the standard XSL DocBook stylesheets.
On Red Hat Linux and Fedora Core, these are in the docbook-style-xsl
package.  On OS X, the easiest way to get these is to install Fink,
and install the docbook-xsl package.  If you know you have the
stylesheets installed, you may have to teach findxsl where to find
them.

The next most likely cause of build failures is not having the right
processing programs installed.  The standard build process uses
xsltproc from the Gnome project to transform the DocBook XML files
into XHTML, and fop from the Apache project to do the transform to
PDF.  See the links below for resources, and alternatives.


If you're looking to hack on the manual, here are some helpful resources
for getting up to speed on DocBook:

	Mills' "Installing And Using An XML/SGML DocBook Editing Suite" article:

		http://tinyurl.com/8alb2

		This is the best tutorial I've found.
		

	Walsh and Muellner's _Simplified DocBook: The Definitive Guide_ book:

		http://www.docbook.org/tdg/simple/en/html/sdocbook.html

		This is the most accessible reference.


	Walsh and Muellner's _DocBook: The Definitive Guide_ book, second
	edition, online version:

		http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/docbook.html

		This is the official DocBook referece; the "Simplified" guide is a
		subset of this book.


	DocBook FAQ:

		http://www.dpawson.co.uk/docbook/

		Go here when you have a question that the tutorials and references
		do not answer.


	xsltproc:

		http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/

		This is the XSL processor that takes the DocBook file and an XSL
		stylesheet and produces either HTML or XSL FO. (The latter is an
		intermediate step towards any of several print-oriented formats,
		such as PDF or TeX.) If your system has GNOME on it, you probably
		have this installed already.


	FOP:

		http://xml.apache.org/fop/

		This is the XSL FO document processor we use to build the PDF
		files. ('make pdf')

		If for some reason you have trouble getting FOP working, there's
		an alternate method available as 'make oldpdf' which uses xsltproc
		and pdfxmltex. It produces a pretty ugly PDF, but you probaly
		already have the tools installed, if you have any of them at all.
		pdfxmltex is in the xmltex package on Fedora Core 3.

		If neither of those work for you, you could use the OpenJade
		tool chain instead. (http://openjade.org/) This is SGML DocBook
		rather than the more modern XML DocBook I favor, but the only
		XML-specific thing we are using is local XSL stylesheets. You
		could ignore them and use the standard DSSSL stylesheets
		instead. I avoid the SGML tool chain only because I've had
		trouble with it in the past.
