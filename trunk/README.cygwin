Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~
	At the moment, Cygwin can only build a static version
	of MySQL++.  Unless you're one of the few that have a
	commercial Cygwin license, this isn't likely to matter to you,
	since without this, your program is under the GPL anyway.
	(See http://www.redhat.com/software/cygwin/ for details.)

	If you're making a closed-source program and do not have a
	commercial Cygwin license, I recommend that you use Visual C++.

	If the cost is the only thing keeping you from using
	Visual C++, there are free versions of VC++ available.
	See the Visual C++ item in the MySQL++ FAQ for details:
	http://tangentsoft.net/mysql++/#faq


Building the Library and Example Programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Before you can build MySQL++, you need to build the MySQL
	client-side library from source. I recommend that you use
	MySQL v4.1.x at this time. The best instructions I've found
	for that are here:

		http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-11/msg00159.html

	Skip the step changing the pthread stuff in my_thr_init.c,
	as it isn't necessary in newer versions of MySQL. With those
	changes applied, build and install MySQL like so:

	$ autoreconf --install --verbose --force
	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var \
	    --infodir=/usr/share/info --mandir=/usr/share/man \
        --disable-shared --without-{debug,readline,libedit,server}
	$ make && make install

	Now that the MySQL client library is built and installed,
	you need to configure MySQL++ to build statically:

	$ ./bootstrap --disable-shared [other options]

	The "other options" are passed to the configure script. See
	README.unix for some suggestions.

	Beyond that, it's the old "make && make install" bit.
