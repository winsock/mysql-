If you are going to hack on the autotools files (*.am, *.in and everything
in the config subdir), run the command:

	$ ./bootstrap [options]

in order to enable "maintainer mode".  This sets up the build system so
that if you change any of these files in the future, their dependents
will be re-generated automatically.  Occasionally automake/autoconf gets
confused and you have to run it again, but this is rare.

The bootstrap script also accepts a 'pedantic' argument, which tells it to
turn on a bunch of GCC-specific flags which make the compiler much pickier
about the source code it will accept without warnings.  It is useful to
enable this mode whenever you are making large changes to the library, to
ensure that you haven't done something silly.  We strive to keep MySQL++
in a state where it never gives compiler warnings in pedantic mode.
We're not 100% there yet with all compilers, but we're trying...
