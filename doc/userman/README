The user manual is written in XML DocBook format, mostly Simplified
DocBook 1.1, with some use of DocBook v4.2 when necessary. (Why v4.2?
Because the oldest system I build MySQL++ on, Red Hat Linux 9, includes
DTDs up to v4.2.)

Some helpful resources for those looking to hack on the manual and need
some instruction in DocBook first:


Mills' "Installing And Using An XML/SGML DocBook Editing Suite" article:

	http://supportweb.cs.bham.ac.uk/documentation/tutorials/docsystem/build/tutorials/docbooksys/docbooksys.html

	This is the best tutorial I've found, which is also complete.
	

Walsh and Muellner's _Simplified DocBook: The Definitive Guide_ book:

	http://www.docbook.org/tdg/simple/en/html/sdocbook.html

	This is the most accessible reference.


Walsh and Muellner's _DocBook: The Definitive Guide_ book, second
edition, online version:

	http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/docbook.html

	This is the document from which the Simplified book was derived.
