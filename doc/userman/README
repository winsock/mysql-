The user manual is written in XML DocBook format, version 4.2.
It uses the official DocBook XSL stylesheets, and will build with
versions as old as 1.58.1.  (Why these versions?  They're what comes
with Red Hat Linux 9, the oldest system I still use.)  We restrict
ourselves to Simplified DocBook 1.1 as much as practical, to make it
easier for new people to get started hacking on the manual.

To make the HTML version of the user manual, just type 'make' in this
directory.  (Or 'make html' if you want to be pedantic.)  To make the
PDF version of the manual, say 'make pdf'.  To make both versions,
say 'make all'.



The most likely cause of build failures is not having the right
processing programs installed.  The DocBook processing model looks
like this:

    DocBook --[XSLT proc.]-+-> HTML
                   ^       |
                   |       +-> XSL-FO --[XSL-FO proc.]--> PDF
                   |
           {XSL stylesheets}

"DocBook" above is a file in DocBook XML format.  In this case,
it's in userman.dbx.

There are many alternatives for the tools in the square brackets:

	The first replaceable piece is an XSLT processor, which
	translates XML into other text formats, such as HTML or other
	varieties of XML.  We use xsltproc from the Gnome project.
	(http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/)  There are numerous alternatives,
	but each supports different extensions to the standard,
	so it's simplest if everyone uses the same processor for a
	given document.

	We use the XSLT processor to do two transforms.  One is
	directly to HTML.  The other is to XSL-FO, an XML-based page
	layout language.  We do this intermediary transform because
	XSLT is not good at creating binary formats like PDF.

	The second replaceable piece in the diagram above is an
	XSL-FO processor, which converts XSL-FO to a more directly
	useful page layout format, like PDF.  We've chosen FOP from
	the Apache Project (http://xml.apache.org/fop/), because it's
	the best of the free-as-in-freedom XSL-FO processors.

	FOP isn't without its faults.  If you'd like to try some of
	the commercial XSL-FO processors, RenderX's XEP (renderx.com)
	is avalable in a free-as-in-beer version that adds watermarks
	to your pages.	Another popular option is Antenna House's XSL
	Formatter (antennahouse.com), but there is no free offering.
	The low-end commercial version of each of these is around $300.
	Another relatively inexpensive option is Lunasil's Xinc
	(lunasil.com), which is available in a personal-use edition
	for under $100.

The third replaceable piece above is the DocBook XSL stylesheet set.
The stylesheets are the XSLT processor's rules, controlling how
the input XML gets transformed to the output format.  The standard
DocBook stylesheet set (link below) includes stylesheets for HTML
and XSL-FO output.  If you don't have them on your system, the XSLT
processor will try to download them using your Internet connection
during processing.  This slows processing quite a bit even if you
have a fast Internet connection, and it obviously doesn't work when
your net connection is down.

A better option is to have a copy of the stylesheets on your system.
It's likely that there is a pre-built package for your system:

	Red Hat Linux: docbook-style-xsl RPM (same for Fedora Core)
	Mac OS X:      docbook-xsl Fink package (http://fink.sf.net)
	Cygwin:        docbook-xml?? package (?? = DocBook version)

(Please send the name of the package for your system to the mailing
list if it isn't listed above, and I'll add it to the list.)

If you can't find a package for your system, you can get the DocBook
stylesheets from the source: http://docbook.sourceforge.net/  They're
a bit tricky to set up correctly, so it's better to use a pre-built
package if you can.

If you are still having problems, post the details about it to the
MySQL++ mailing list, and I'll try to help you debug the problem.
You might also find the FOP and/or DocBook mailing lists helpful.
